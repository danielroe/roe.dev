> The below is a letter I sent earlier this week to the organiser of [Modern Frontends](https://www.modernfrontends.live/), a conference I attended in London. I am publishing it to stand in solidarity with those who have also raised concerns.

Dear Gen,

I wanted to write to thank you for the invitation to speak at Modern Frontends and also raise some concerns I have.

For a start, let me say how much I enjoyed myself. The speakers were great! What an amazing speakers’ dinner on a floating hotel. And I loved meeting people from the tech community in London.

You and I had a few moments to chat, particularly when you were feeling embattled because of comments on Twitter, and I’m sure you’ve seen these posts as they went up:

</ul>

I would say their summary of the facts on the ground is fair.

I can imagine how disappointed you must feel that the conference didn’t turn out the way you had dreamed. You staked your reputation on a big event of 3000+ attendees and some amazing speakers.

On top of feeling short-handed, with a bereaved team member out of action, I would guess it then felt like being punched below the belt when tweets started coming in about the missing livestream, the low attendance, the low-quality catering, or the sponsors who felt they had been missold an event. 

But I hope we can agree that taking responsibility is part of what leadership means. I don’t know if you would value hearing my advice, but if so, I’d recommend:

1. Make an apology. Acknowledge what people know to be true. And do so without excuses. This should be to attendees, speakers and sponsors - and publicly, not via email.
2. May I suggest, if possible, you publicly offer to compensate speakers who paid their way personally? I was wrong to ignore this red flag in advance and am convinced that this is the [right default behaviour](https://nielsleenheer.com/articles/2022/red-flag-speakers-having-to-cover-their-own-travel/), with some few exceptions. You paid part of my costs to attend, for which I’m grateful, and I would happily donate that to help anyone who is in financial trouble.
3. And finally, consider refunding sponsors some part of their fee as a recognition of the fact that this was not what they signed on for.

I hope things can be resolved and wish you the best for the future.

Regards,<br>
Daniel
