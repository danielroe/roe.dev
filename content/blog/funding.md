Being a full-time open-source maintainer is a rare privilege. In the interests of transparency, let me explain a little more about how I am funded.

## My story

I had been increasingly involved in open source - and particularly in contributing to the [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) ecosystem - whilst running first a creative agency and then a SaaS startup.

But when I decided (with my co-founder) to shut down the startup, [S√©bastien Chopin](https://atinux.com/) asked if he could sponsor me to work on Nuxt. I was already committed to the core team - so it didn't take me long to accept.

The majority of my funding comes from a retainer with [NuxtLabs](https://nuxtlabs.com).

S√©bastien Chopin, who created Nuxt and founded NuxtLabs, receives donations via the Nuxt GitHub Sponsors account (and other income streams) and in turn funnels that back into the community, sponsoring [a number of open-source developers](https://github.com/orgs/nuxtlabs/sponsoring) and enabling open-source work.

I prize my independence highly and deeply appreciate S√©bastien's trust.

## Sponsorship

While I don't receive any direct funding from Nuxt via GitHub Sponsors, I do have [a number of individual and corporate sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/danielroe) that I value very highly.

I see [open source as about 'mutual giving'](/blog/contributing-to-nuxt#what-open-source-is-to-me) and I appreciate these givers.

Their kindness enables me to devote additional time to open source, and to ensure it remains sustainable for me. I am looking for opportunities to thank my sponsors for their generosity, and would welcome ideas üôè

## Workshops and conferences

I am sometimes asked to give paid-for workshops at conferences, and I receive a share of the revenue of these workshops.

In addition, conferences cover the costs of my flights and hotel and (sometimes) a speaker's fee.

If cost is ever a factor, **please ask**. I do not charge for community events, nor do I speak at conferences for financial reasons.

## Streaming

I receive some revenue from [streaming on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/danielroe). I do not enable ads or otherwise seek to monetise the streams.

## Consultancy

The time I have to work on projects outside of open source is limited. However, real-world projects help keep me relevant and grounded.

If you think your company would value a consultancy arrangement with me, please reach out. I am looking for:

- recurring duration (such as a monthly retainer)
- scheduled and measurable contributions

It is also possible to book a single hour's consultation with me.
