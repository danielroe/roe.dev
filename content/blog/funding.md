Being a full-time open source maintainer is a rare privilege. In the interests of transparency, let me explain a little more about how I am funded.

## My story

I had been increasingly involved in open source - and particularly in contributing to the [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) ecosystem - whilst running first a creative agency and then a SaaS startup.

But when I decided (with my co-founder) to shut down the startup, [S√©bastien Chopin](https://atinux.com/) asked if he could sponsor me to work on Nuxt. I was already committed to the core team - so it didn't take me long to accept.

That enabled me to work on Nuxt full-time, and I was able to do so for several years, before [NuxtLabs was acquired by Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/nuxtlabs-joins-vercel) in July 2025.

I also accepted a position at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), where I have the privilege of working full-time as the Nuxt project lead.

I prize my independence highly and deeply appreciate the trust of S√©bastien and the team at Vercel.

## Sponsorship

While I don't receive any direct funding from Nuxt via GitHub Sponsors, I do have [a number of individual and corporate sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/danielroe) that I value very highly.

I see [open source as about 'mutual giving'](/blog/contributing-to-nuxt#what-open source-is-to-me) and I appreciate these givers.

<!-- TODO: sponsor carousel -->

Their kindness is deeply appreciated. I am looking for opportunities to thank my sponsors for their generosity, and would welcome ideas üôè

## Workshops and conferences

I am sometimes asked to give paid-for workshops at conferences, and I have in past received a share of the revenue of these workshops.

In addition, conferences cover the costs of my flights and hotel and (sometimes) a speaker's fee.

If cost is ever a factor, **please ask**. I do not charge for community events, nor do I speak at conferences for financial reasons.

## Streaming

I receive some revenue from [streaming on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/danielroe). I do not enable ads or otherwise seek to monetise the streams.
