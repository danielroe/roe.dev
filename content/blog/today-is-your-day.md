What a year.

Reflection isn't my strong suit. I think. But I wish it were more part of my life. So I thought I'd try to piece together &hellip; part of &hellip;  my story in 2024.

## Oh, the places you'll go!

<div>

This year, I've attended conferences or meetups in Toronto, Prague, Seattle, Amsterdam, Glasgow, Middlesbrough, Bonn, Portlaoise, Athens, New Orleans, San Francisco, London and Edinburgh. I've also enjoyed making [EdinburghJS](https://www.edinburghjs.org/) a regular part of my life.

I've loved every moment of it. Not the places, so much as the _people_. The tech world is amazing - and the greatest part for me is meeting people I respect and collaborate with.

It's not just holiday though. For me, time spent travelling is productive. I love coding on the plane or train - it's often joyously focused - and I always notice bursts of creativity after conferences.

- **Next year, I'd like to widen the circle**.

I'd like to see more folk I don't already know. That will mean answering CFPs at conferences further afield. Recommendations welcome üôè

## You‚Äôll be seeing great sights!

This was the second year that I have [led Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/blog/vision-2023). It's been exhilarating to see how things have grown.

<a class="my-4" href="https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/meta-frameworks/">
<img src="/img/today-is-your-day/state-of-js-nuxt-positivity.png" alt="Git Wrapped profile for @danielroe" height="1104" width="2148">
</a>

We're rising both in retention, positivity and awareness compared to other meta-frameworks. I don't claim credit for that - but it's a pleasure to be a part of the community that make that possible.

This isn't a zero-sum game. Nuxt doesn't 'lose' when other frameworks do well. I want to see our community characterised by the kind of relentless kindness that (I firmly believe) will in the end lead to continued growth and success.

The [unjs project](https://github.com/unjs) is an example of our communitment to go further, together, and I'm delighted to see [other](https://analogjs.org/) [frameworks](https://start.solidjs.com/) [are](https://tanstack.com/start) joining us in building on top of [Nitro](https://nitro.build/).

I've spent most of this year focusing on improving the _stability_ and _trustworthiness_ of the Nuxt ecosystem in the run-up to the release of Nuxt v4, but that has meant feeling a little bit lost in the details.

I have managed to launch a few projects, from [Nuxt Fonts](https://github.com/nuxt/fonts), [unifont](https://github.com/unjs/unifont), [page-speed.dev](https://github.com/danielroe/page-speed.dev) to smaller ones like [oxc-walker](https://github.com/danielroe/oxc-walker), [impound](https://github.com/unjs/impound), [errx](http://github.com/unjs/errx), [zero-vue](https://github.com/danielroe/zero-vue), [nuxt-workers](https://github.com/danielroe/nuxt-workers) or [nuxt-rebundle](https://github.com/danielroe/nuxt-rebundle).

Nevertheless it feels like my idea list is overflowing, and I would _love_ more time to create features or launch new projects! ‚ú®

- **Next year, I want to do more _pioneering_**.

## You‚Äôre off and away!

I _love_ coding. It's fun and my hobby. I don't have an objective to be 'active' every day. But, as it happens, I have been.

I count myself incredibly fortunate to be able to make a living from being a [full-time open source maintainer](/blog/funding).

It's something I _get_ to do rather than _have_ to.

That's one reason I stream maintenance, building things or talking to people. (You can find me on [Algora](https://tv.algora.io/danielroe), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/danielroe) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@danielroe)). I think of it as 'coding with friends' and it's part of the fun.

If you've joined me on stream, sponsored me, contributed to Nuxt - or supported me in any of the other many ways people have made my life a joy this year, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

- **Next year, I want to continue to take joy in my work**.

## There is fun to be done!

In early 2023, arriving back from New Year holidays, I realised that I had really neglected my own health. On recommendation from [Jessica Sachs](https://jess.sh/) and [Marc Backes](https://marc.dev/), I downloaded [Noom](https://www.noom.com/), dusted off my [Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/) and set off to look after myself a bit more.

That year I lost 15 kg - and found my way back to good health. I also discovered some things that I loved doing - like _bouldering_.

</a>

I've been bouldering just over a year (I started in September 2023), and in that time - mostly in 2024 - I've climbed in 35 gyms around the world. It's a lovely, inclusive community.

(If you ever fancy joining me for a climb (even as a total beginner!) you'd be very welcome.)

More importantly, along the way, I discovered the importance of looking after my own needs. Rather than living entirely in my head, I think it's important to enjoy physicality and being 'embodied'.

- **Next year, I want to get more in touch with myself**.

I don't entirely know what that means, but I want to continue to live in sync with what I need.

## You‚Äôll join the high fliers who soar to high heights

I was tremendously honoured this year to [join the ranks of GitHub Stars](https://stars.github.com/profiles/danielroe/). I loved joining others at GitHub Universe and meeting folk in San Francisco - which absolutely lived up to its reputation!

I was also mentioned by some of those filling out the State of JS 2024 survey. Thank you - it means a great deal. ‚ù§Ô∏è

- **Next year, I don't want to settle for where I am right now**.

## Bang-ups and hang-ups can happen to you

This year has brought it's own share of pain. I don't think that's unusual, but my own griefs are dear to me - at least because they are mine.

I don't particularly want to write about them here, but for me it's important that I _really feel_ these things, not set them aside.

- **Next year, I want to take time to feel the things that hurt, too**.

## And YOU are the one who‚Äôll decide where to go

I'm optimistic about the future. I don't know exactly what it will hold, of course - but let's surf the chaos together. Here's to another year of joy and love, friendship and fun! üçª
