A few months ago I tweeted out an open invitation for anyone new to contributing to open source.

::social-post{link=https://twitter.com/danielcroe/status/1630239320375463937 datetime=2023-02-27T16:11:57.000Z social=twitter}
If you're new to contributing to open source or [@nuxt_js](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js), and want to, let me know. I'd be really happy to have an informal chat, pre-PR review, etc. ❤️

When people messaged me, I sent through a link so they could book a short call at a time that worked for them.

I was honestly astounded at how many people wanted to chat. People I had never met or encountered. And even people I 'knew' from online. Some wanted to contribute but were entirely new to open source. Some had ideas they wanted the chance to implement. A couple wanted me to 'pitch' Nuxt to them.

## What I learned

1. I had mixed feelings that _so many_ people wanted to talk - at first. Seeing virtually every free day I had be booked for the next month was a little daunting.

1. Looking back at those calls, I don't regret a single one. A number of people I'd now consider valuable contributors to Nuxt messaged me - and we had a chance to talk for the first time. And I think there were plenty of folk who would be assets to any project.

1. I've summarised [a few thoughts](/blog/contributing-to-nuxt) about contributing to Nuxt that came out of these calls.

1. I absolutely want to have an open-door policy in future.

## An open invitation

So here's the deal. If you want to have a 10-minute chat about anything, then I would love to talk to you.

Particularly, if you want to be involved in open source and you feel you lack _experience_ or _background_, please let me know. I will make time for you and I know others will too.

## Consultancy

I also want to make it easy for people to engage me a professional basis. I am fairly limited in terms of the time I have, but I'm happy to make it easy to book an hour's call.
