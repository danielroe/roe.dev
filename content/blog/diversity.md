This really shouldn't need to be written:

I'm in favour of diversity, equity and inclusion.

Let me explain why.

## Politics

But first, this isn't political.

By that, I mean it's not party-political. What I think and say about diversity, equity and inclusion isn't because of my political views.

Rather, I'm writing about _values_ - core beliefs. Values are the things that should shape our politics. They should affect who we vote for and who we align ourselves with.

For that reason, I think it's dangerous when your politics starts shaping your values. That can lead to extremism and tribalism - and demonising people who vote differently. My opinion? We should talk less about politics, and more about values - even if that's dismissed as 'political'.

Hold your politics lightly but your values tightly.

## Direction

In fact, I would be remiss _not_ to speak about values.

Values shape the direction of projects and people. They also shape the culture of open-source communities. They make the difference both in where we end up and what the journey there is like.

As a leader, whatever you say matters.

Even if you say nothing. Especially if you say nothing.

So here are a few reasons why diversity, equity and inclusion will be core values in any project I'm involved with.

## Diversity

I can think of no better way to stop growing as a person than to be always around people who are just like me.

Being around people who are not the same as us broadens and strengthens us.

Not to mention, it's more fun.

There's also another very real way diversity is a necessity in open source.

In building any product - or open source project! - one of the most valuable skills is _empathy_: the ability to place yourself in the position of someone using your product.

That is true for developer tooling too. It's a bit easier because we're developers already - we're much closer to the 'user'. In a sense we can build for ourselves.

But there's diversity amongst developers. We have different needs.

If we take that seriously - if value empathy - then the value of diversity within a team isn't controversial at all.

Sometimes diversity and capability are seen as opposite poles. And that's an insult, honestly, that I won't even bother to respond to. If you think that, please take a long hard look in the mirror.

It should go without saying, but I would _love_ to see increased diversity of backgrounds in the Nuxt team and contributors.

## Equity

There's a very strong sense of fairness in open source. Projects like Nuxt are community-based. It really matters how things feel and how people are treated.

It's important to recognise that we don't all start from the same place. Making adjustments to accommodate differences isn't special treatment - it's creating a level playing field.

If people are treated badly, or unfairly, then we need to make it right. Please don't be silent about it. I've written [a little bit about it](/blog/governance-and-abuse).

## Inclusion

I'm an outsider to the tech world, even if I'm privileged in many other ways. I know what it was to be welcomed in. I'd like that to be true for many more people too. 'Freely you have received, freely give,' are words that mean a lot to me. Plus, half of the fun of open source is in working collaboratively.

So from my point of view, open source is and should be _open_. Come on in! We'd love to have you. And [have a chat with me](/blog/open-invitation/) if that would be helpful!

## Why write this?

Nuxt, like many other projects, adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). You can read our code of conduct [here](https://github.com/nuxt/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We're not unique in caring about diversity, equity and inclusion.

I'm not winning any friends by writing this. People who like me already probably know where I stand on this. And those who disagree might find me overbearing.

But I think it's important to speak clearly about this for several reasons:

1. I want people of all backgrounds to know that you are welcome in projects I'm involved with.

1. 'Diversity, equity and inclusion' are being rejected at government and corporate levels. In places they are _banned terms_. Silence in the face of this becomes implicit acceptance.

1. I want people to reconsider letting their values be shaped by their politics. Whatever country you live in, and whoever you vote for there, this is more important.

The strength of open source has always been its community. And the strongest communities are those where everyone can contribute their unique perspectives and talents.

I would be very glad of your thoughts on how we can better implement these values.
