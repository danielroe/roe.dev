Open source is about mutual giving. So how does that square with commercial open source? Or building a for-profit product _on top_ of an open source project?

There are plenty of examples of projects that (at some point) push back against third-party commercialisation, whether that's [MongoDB](https://investors.mongodb.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mongodb-issues-new-server-side-public-license-mongodb-community) or [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification). And it's also not uncommon to see open source developers become jaded, disillusioned and bitter that the money being made using their software isn't flowing back to them.

In recent days, the most obvious example of that is Matt Mullenweg of WordPress, whose [lawsuit against WP Engine](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine) seems to stem from a frustration that they are profiting from something he has built.

If I can communicate one thing on my own behalf here, it's this:

> ðŸ‘‰ Flourish! Build a company if that's your thing. Bless the people who work for you. Make money. Enjoy! No strings attached.

By default, if you are building with Nuxt, **I want you to succeed**.
If you are a third-party provider with a great Nuxt module or integration, **I want you to succeed**.
If you are creating a course to teach other developers, **I want you to succeed**.
If you're a consultant helping people make great, performant Nuxt sites, **I want you to succeed**.

... and I don't want that goodwill to be conditional on sponsorship or 'paying Nuxt back'. Nor do I care if you are 'competing' with me (or any of the Nuxt team).

Here's why I feel that way:

1. **Open source is a community project**. I can't possibly feel bitter about not getting 'what I deserve' when it's not me, but a whole group of talented and lovely people who have made it possible. In many cases - including my own - we have done so _because_ there were no strings attached.
1. **Compensation doesn't follow value**. If I start trying to find my value in how many donations or sponsorships I get, I'll destroy my own mental health. Better to let go of that _expectation_. And, where I need compensation, find it by seeking it out in consultancy, entrepreneurship, retainer or employment.
1. **Success is contagious**. The more commercial projects succeed, building on top of open source work, the more the whole ecosystem benefits. Jobs are created. Conferences flourish. Educators produce articles and videos. More people contribute. More companies are created.

Someone recently wrote to me via an [#ama](https://bsky.app/hashtag/ama?author=danielroe.dev):

> Should I feel bad for trying to make a for-profit product using Nuxt ecosystem? It's unbelievable how many great free things it offers, it makes me feel kinda bad trying to use it for my own benefit

My answer is pretty simple: Don't feel bad. Build your product - and flourish!

âˆ— I'm speaking about *my* feelings, but if anyone should be 'paid back' for Nuxt it would probably be Sebastien & Alex Chopin, who created it in the first place.
